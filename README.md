> A comprehensive tool for analyzing and identifying security vulnerabilities in blockchain smart contracts.

## Vision Statement
Fluffy Bassoon aims to provide critical insights into the security posture of blockchain smart contracts, enabling proactive risk mitigation and enhancing the overall security landscape of blockchain applications.

## Key Features
- **Static Code Analysis**: Detect vulnerabilities in smart contract code.
- **Dynamic Testing**: Execute smart contracts in a controlled environment to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on identified vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for the application.
- **Vyper**: Smart contract programming language.
- **Truffle**: Development framework for Ethereum.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language (if applicable).
